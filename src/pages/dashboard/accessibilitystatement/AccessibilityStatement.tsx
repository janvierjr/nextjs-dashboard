          Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles,
          or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities.[1] The
          concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development
          ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access"
          meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology[2] (for
          example, computer screen readers).
        </span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span>
          Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit
          from some system or entity. The concept focuses on enabling access for
          people with disabilities, or enabling access through the use of
          assistive technology; however, research and development in
          accessibility brings benefits to everyone.[3][4][5][6][7] Therefore,
          an accessible society should eliminate digital divide or knowledge
          divide.
        </span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span>
          Accessibility is not to be confused with usability, which is the
          extent to which a product (such as a device, service, or environment)
          can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with
          effectiveness, efficiency, convenience, or satisfaction in a specified
          context of use.[8]
        </span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span>
          Accessibility is also strongly related to universal design, the
          process of creating products that are usable by the widest possible
          range of people, operating within the widest possible range of
          situations.[9]
        </span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span>
          Universal design typically provides a single general solution that can
          accommodate people with disabilities as well as the rest of the
          population. By contrast, accessible design is focused on ensuring that
          there are no barriers to accessibility for all people, including those
          with disabilities.
