      <p>
        Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions,
        commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&C) are the legal agreements
        between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service.
        The person must agree to abide by the terms of service in order to use
        the offered service.[1] Terms of service can also be merely a
        disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and
        lengthy sentences used in the terms of use have caused concerns about
        customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.
